# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory
## Description
This app lets users sort the table data in ascending order by ID number, name, age or salary. The data of the employee list comes from a json file from the src folder, so users do not have an option to add/remove any data.

There is also a toggle button to display the list in either ascending (L > H) or descending (H > L) order.
