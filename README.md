# Employee Directory
## Description
<<<<<<< HEAD
This app lets users sort the table data in ascending order by ID number, name, age or salary. The data of the employee list comes from a json file from the src folder, so users do not have an option to add/remove any data.

There is also a toggle button to display the list in either ascending (L > H) or descending (H > L) order.

=======
This app lets users sort the table data in ascending order by ID number, name, age or salary. The sample data comes from a json file in the src folder, and users have no option to add/remove any data.

This app uses React JS to display the items using refactored components. The sorting options do not cause a refresh of the page due to the being a one-page app based on React. This was a practice app to get familiar with using and understanding React JS.

The styling on the page involves Bootstrap CSS to quickly create a simple front-end.

## Installation
None! Just go to deployed app at https://umutamac.github.io/employee-directory/

## Usage
Once the page loads, click on an of the 4 buttons below the title to sort the table in different ways.
